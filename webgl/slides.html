<h1> Shaders in OpenGL </h1>
You've probably of shaders before, maybe in the context of a custom minecraft or skyrim mod.
And if you are were like me, you have no idea what they are actually about.

To give a mile-high overview of what shaders are, shaders are the piece of code that takes a 3D scene and turns it into a picture 
So this talk is meant to give a pretty in-depth, technical explanation of exactly how shaders do what they do.

I myself first learned about shaders a little over a year ago.  I took a game architecture class in college,
and I was really intrigued at how the game engine actually drew each frame.  So I learned all I could about shaders so I could implement
them myself.  Obviously Im no expert, this talk is targetted mainly for beginner.  With that said, lets get started.

Before jumping into shaders, lets talk about the emvironment in which they are used.  Shaders can come in different languages.
You may have heard of Direct3D, or Apple's new Metal framework.  The one we'll be looking at today is called OpenGL, which stands 
for Open Graphics Library, and it uses GLSL - OpenGL Shading Language.
OpenGL is just an API for rendering graphics.  It lets you do things like upload a list of vertices, textures, and any other data you have
it then sends all that data through graphics pipline.

And technically, OpenGL is just a specification.
To use OpenGL, you need a implementation of it, which exists in many different languages.
By default, it has C bindings, but if you want to use JavaScript, there is WebGL.

OpenGL is extremely boiler-platey.  A simple program is going to have hundreds of lines of code.
As a result, basically everyone working with it will use some sort of library on top of it.
In Javascript, the most popular one I believe is called Three.js.
